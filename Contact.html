    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>What is your adoption process?</h3>
    <p>Our adoption process starts with filling out an application and meeting with one of our adoption specialists. The
        specialist will help you find the perfect pet to match your lifestyle and home. If the match is a success, you
        will complete the adoption process and take your new furry friend home!</p>

    <h3>What are the adoption fees?</h3>
    <p>The adoption fees vary based on the age, breed, and size of the animal. Our adoption specialists can provide more
        information on the fees for each individual pet. The fees typically include spaying/neutering, vaccinations,
        microchipping, and any other necessary medical treatment.</p>

    <h3>Do you have a return policy?</h3>
    <p>Yes, we have a return policy in place to ensure that every pet finds the right home. If for any reason the
        adoption is not a success, the pet may be returned to us. Our adoption specialists are available to help you
        through the process and find a better match if needed.</p>

    <h3>What if I can no longer care for my adopted pet?</h3>
    <p>If you are unable to continue caring for your adopted pet, please contact us. We will work with you to find a
        suitable solution, whether it be returning the pet to our center or helping you find a new home through our
        network of contacts.</p>
